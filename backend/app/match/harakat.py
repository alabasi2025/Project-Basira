"""Harakat (vocalisation) gate — QURAN ONLY (invariant I11, audit B01, owner policy 2026-10-03).

Hadith vocalisation in any edition is editorial, not canonical, so it is never gated.

Policy
------
1. A vowel mark the user **wrote** that contradicts the Mushaf on the same letter is a difference —
   **wherever** the letter sits, including the last letter of the word («يَخْشَى اللَّهُ» vs «ٱللَّهَ»
   flips subject and object in 35:28). Any such *conflict* → the quote is never `found`.
2. A mark the user did **not** write is never a contradiction. Every letter whose Mushaf mark is
   absent is reported as *missing* (the pipeline only runs this gate when the quote carries any mark
   at all, so a bare quote is never annotated) so the reader sees exactly
   what was dropped (39:53 half-vocalised). Status stays `found`; a notice is added.
3. The single exception: a **sukun on the last letter of the whole quote** where the Mushaf has a
   vowel or tanween is the pausal form (waqf) — reported as *waqf*, status `found`, a note is added.
   The same sukun anywhere else in the quote is a conflict.
4. A completely bare quote (no vowel marks at all) produces nothing — unchanged behaviour.

Reference text
--------------
Comparison runs against Tanzil «simple» (fully vocalised, common orthography) when it is word-aligned
with the quote — its letters are exactly what users type, so marks align letter-for-letter. The Uthmani
display text is the fallback. If the base-letter counts of a word pair differ in both references the
word is *unalignable* → ``None`` → the caller must not claim the vocalisation was verified.

Marks: fatha/damma/kasra, the three tanween (incl. open Uthmani forms U+08F0–U+08F2), shadda, sukun
(U+0652 and the Uthmani round/oval zeros U+06E1/U+06DF/U+06E0). Dagger alif, small letters, madda,
stop signs are rasm notation — ignored. Shadda is compared only when the user wrote it (a missing
shadda is "missing", a written shadda where the Mushaf has none is a conflict).

The module never alters any displayed text; it returns character ranges inside the user's word and the
reference word so the UI can highlight exactly the letter.
